<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This Web API was created as a take home assignment for a Software Developer Internship application. 

Key Features
- Separation of Concerns: Separate projects for API and Application
- Inversion of Control: Dependency injection used to connect the Application to the API 

Constraints:
- Total Repo size doesn't account for shared objects, and thus may be less than actual size: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8646517/how-can-i-see-the-size-of-a-github-repository-before-cloning-it
- The second consecutive call to SearchRepo() will have the SearchOptions of the prior call (e.g. If the first call has ExcludeForkedRepos, and the second has IncludeForkedRepos, then the second will still exclude forked repo in its result).
